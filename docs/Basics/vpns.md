# VPNs

We have two main VPN security measures at PennLINC. One is called Big IP f5 VPN, and is used to connect to any UPHS & Penn Medicine service, including the CUBIC cluster and CBICA wiki.

The other is Pulse Secure VPN, which is mainly used for connecting to the PMACS cluster.

To reset your PennMedicine password for the VPN (which expires once a year), simply go to [reset.uphs.upenn.edu](reset.uphs.upenn.edu), enter your username + last four digits of SSN. If this does not work, you may need to call UPHS service desk at 215-662-7474, and they will expire your password so that you can reset it manually.
