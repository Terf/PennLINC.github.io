# Current Projects

These pages provide an overview of the current projects completed/close to completion in the lab.

To add a project to this list, please first read the [documentation guide](/docs/Contributing/contributing) to familiarize yourself with the process of adding docs to this website. When it comes time to add your file, create a new markdown document in `/docs/CurrentProjects/<YOURPROJECTNAME>.md`. At the top of the file, insert a YAML header like the one below:

```
---
layout: default
title: MY PROJECT NAME # keep this short!!!
has_children: false
parent: Current Projects
---
```

A template of the content of the project page is below. Simply copy it into your markdown file and fill in the relevant fields. Each project should additionally have a GitHub Pages site â€” if you've never made a Github pages site, see the tutorial [here](/docs/Contributing/project-documentation/).

For additional information see the [Project Setup Page](/docs/LabHome/ProjectSetup/).
