## Prepping the Expenditure Justification reports
For each expenditure you must first prepare the standardized Expenditure Justification report and previously approved justification report examples can be found XXXXX. You can copy and paste exact wording from previously approved documents.

### Fill out Expenditure Form
_Project Title_: Fill in the name of the study the expense will be billed to

_Principle Investigator_: Dr. Theodore Satterthwaite

_Project/Grant Number_: Nickname for project/Sponsor

- ACTTION Grant [400-4425-4-573869-xxxx-2810-3435]
- BigDev (Reproducible Brain Chart) = 1R01 MH120482 [400-4425-4-573811-xxxx-2810-3435]
- BPD Gift fund [400-4425-1-604076-xxxx-2000-3435]
- Executive Function = NIMH - R01MH113550 [400-4425-4-574248-xxxx-2810-3435]
- Ted's SOM Account [400-4425-2-014001-xxxx-2000-3435]

_Funding Source_: See the above funding sources listed above in brackets for Ted's current projects. You can always ask John Hyon if you are unsure of the funding source number.

_Description of Expense_: Brief description including how the expense was paid for and to which vendor. (ex. To reimburse Dr. Satterthwaite for monthly subscription to CircleCI vendor for data management)

_Amount of Expense_: Total amount requesting reimbursement, itemize if necessary.

_Date of Expense_: Date that the transaction occurred

_Explanation or Cost Allocation and Justification of Expense_: Fill out why the expense was necessary. See examples.

_Signature_: Obtain Ted's signature and other necessary approvals (if not being reimbursed back to Ted)

### Approval from Business Administrator, John Hyon
Send the prepared Expenditure Justification in word document form to John Hyon (Hyon1@pennmedicine.upenn.edu) for approval.

Make sure to also send the receipt for all expenses. The receipt _must include_ the confirmation of payment (not just the invoice), how the payment was made (typically last 4 digits of the card listed on receipt), each expense itemized, the total amount paid, and the date the payment was completed.

John may give you edits, but once the form has been approved you can convert the document to PDF to be uploaded to CONCUR.


## Submitting report via CONCUR
Navigate to the [CONCUR website](https://cms.business-services.upenn.edu/penntravel/expense-report.html), click on the "CONCUR" icon, and sign in with your PennKey

### Start Your Report

<img src="/assets/images/startareport.png" alt="startareport">

### Complete Report Header
- _Type of Travel/Reimbursement_: if expense involves travel, you will select either domestic, international, local (<50mi.); any other expense, you will select Non-Travel Expense
- _Country Code_: Whatever country the expenses are from

### CONCUR Report Main Page
- Select "New Expense" and select the category that best matches your expense
  - Note: each receipt must have it's own expense entry, each item on the receipt must be itemized below it's entry.
  - For Ex. If you are creating a report for a conference where you took a flight that had taxes and paid for conference registration, these would be two expenses under the same report. One expense will be “flight” which you will itemize for cost of flight and then taxes (see example below). The other expense will be listed as “conference fees” This can be tricky but Sharon Lui and Sophia Linguiti can be resources if you need help.
  - Note: Alcohol can never be reimbursed via University/Grant Funds and Taxes are not reimbursed. Can mark those items as "non-reimbursable" under the itemization
- Enter the vendor, transaction date, city, total amount, and a business justification similar to that listed on the report header.
- Click "attach receipt" on the bottom right where you will attach both the _receipt_ for the expense and the _expenditure justification form_
- Click _SUBMIT_ when you are done

  - You will get a notification within a few days if the concur report has been approved or if it has been sent back with  edits.
